  abstract = {This paper addresses unconstrained multiobjective optimization problems where two or more continuously differentiable functions have to be minimized. We delve into the conjugate gradient methods proposed by Lucambio P{\textasciiacute}erez and Prudente (SIAM J Optim, 28(3): 2690--2720, 2018) for such problems. Instead of the Wolfe-type line search procedure used in their work, we employ a fixed stepsize formula (or noline-search scheme), which can mitigate the pressure of choosing stepsize caused by multiple inequalities and avoid the computational cost associated with function evaluations in specific applications. The noline-search scheme is utilized to derive the condition of Zoutendijk's type. Global convergence encompasses the vector extensions of Fletcher--Reeves, conjugate descent, Dai--Yuan, Polak--Ribi`ere--Polyak and Hestenes--Stiefel parameters, subject to certain mild assumptions. Additionally, numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed stepsize rule, and comparative analyses are made with the multiobjective steepest descent methods using the Armijo line search and the multiobjective conjugate gradient methods using the Wolfe-type line search.},

A strategy for reduction of objective function calls is often essential, at a fixed degree of Pareto Optimal Front (POF) approximation accuracy . To this aim an extension of single-objective NN-based GRS methods to Pareto Optimal Front (POF) approximation is proposed. Such an extension is not at all straightforward due to the complex relation between the POF and Pareto Optimal Set (POS). As a consequence of such a complexity, it is extremely difficult to identify a multi-objective analogue of the single-objective current optimum region; consequently the design domain search space zooming strategy, which is the core of a GRS method, is to be carefully reconsidered when POFappro ximation is concerned.},

Newton's direction at each iterate is obtained by minimizing the max-ordering scalarization of the variations on the quadratic approximations of the objective functions. The objective functions are assumed to be twice continuously differentiable and locally strongly convex. Under these hypotheses, the method, as in the classical case, is locally superlinear convergent to optimal points. Again as in the scalar case, if the second derivatives are Lipschitz continuous, the rate of convergence is quadratic. Our convergence analysis uses a Kantorovich-like technique. As a byproduct, existence of optima is obtained under semilocal assumptions.},

The main part of the most successful algorithms such as PESA, or NSGA-II, are the Pareto based selection strategy that decide survivors using dominance among individuals. However, does the Pareto based selection strategy always succeed in finding the Pareto optimal solutions? This paper shows a very simple example that can cause serious trouble for the Pareto based MOEAs. In such an instance, various solutions, which are apart from the true Pareto-optimums, are left as hardly-dominated solutions. We define such solutions as dominance resistant solutions (DRSs), and show a class of problems which produces DRSs easily. To cope with this difficulty we propose the /spl alpha/-domination strategy that relaxes the domination introducing a weak trade-off among objectives. With the /spl alpha/-domination strategy, the DRSs are effectively purged from the population.},

Our algorithm uses a weighted sum of multiple objectives as a fitness function. The fitness function is utilized when a pair of parent solutions are selected for generating a new solution by crossover and mutation operations. A local search procedure is applied to the new solution to maximize its fitness value. One characteristic feature of our algorithm is to randomly specify weight values whenever a pair of parent solutions are selected. That is, each selection (i.e., the selection of two parent solutions) is performed by a different weight vector. Another characteristic feature of our algorithm is not to examine all neighborhood solutions of a current solution in the local search procedure. Only a small number of neighborhood solutions are examined to prevent the local search procedure from spending almost all available computation time in our algorithm. High performance of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to multi objective flowshop scheduling problems.},

In this paper, a theory on why CWA fails for multi-objective problems with a concave Pareto front is provided schematically. According to this theory, it can easily be explained why EDWA has worked well for both convex and concave multi-objective problems.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method that effectively determines a Pareto front for bi-objective optimization with potential application to multiple objectives. A traditional method for multiobjective optimization is the weighted-sum method, which seeks Pareto optimal solutions one by one by systematically changing the weights among the objective functions. Previous research has shown that this method often produces poorly distributed solutions along a Pareto front, and that it does not find Pareto optimal solutions in nonconvex regions. The proposed adaptive weighted sum method focuses on unexplored regions by changing the weights adaptively rather than by using a priori weight selections and by specifying additional inequality constraints. It is demonstrated that the adaptive weighted sum method produces well-distributed solutions, finds Pareto optimal solutions in non-convex regions, and neglects non-Pareto optimal solutions. This last point can be a potential liability of Normal Boundary Intersection, an otherwise successful multiobjective method, which is mainly caused by its reliance on equality constraints. The promise of this robust algorithm is demonstrated with two numerical examples and a simple structural optimization problem.},

The key tool to define the mentioned vector field is the notion of vector pseudogradient. We prove that the limit points of the solutions of the system satisfy the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) first order necessary condition for the box-constrained multi-objective optimization problem. These results allow us to develop an algorithm to solve box-constrained multi-objective optimization problems.

In particular, the steepest descent and the Newton methods were studied for the unconstrained case.

As a consequence, the objective function values decrease at each iteration of the algorithms. In this work, we consider nonmonotone line searches, i.e., we allow the increase of objective function values in some iterations. Two well-known types of nonmonotone line searches are considered here: the one that takes the maximum of recent function values, and the one that takes their average. We also propose a new nonmonotone technique specifically for multiobjective problems. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that every accumulation point of the sequence produced by the nonmonotone version of the steepest descent and Newton methods is Pareto critical. Moreover, we present some numerical experiments, showing that the nonmonotone technique is also efficient in the multiobjective case.},

In these cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands a user to have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. In this paper, Pareto-based Continuous Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization problems having continuous search space are introduced. These algorithms are based on Continuous Evolutionary Algorithms, which were developed by the authors to solve single-objective optimization problems with a continuous function and continuous search space efficiently. For multiobjective optimization, a progressive reproduction operator and a niche-formation method for fitness sharing and a storing process for elitism are implemented in the algorithm. The operator and the niche formulation allow the solution set to be distributed widely over the Pareto-optimal tradeoff surface. Finally, the validity of this method has been demonstrated through some numerical examples.}
